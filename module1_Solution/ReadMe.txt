I have done the Following
1. Done the Basic Assignment
   a. Use the Base code provided in Assignment folder
   b. Added Logic to Display "Enjoy!" or "Too Much", based on the number of strings entered
   c. Used "," as the split value
2. Done the Bonus Part of the assignment
   a. Changed the Text Color of "Enjoy!" of "Too Much" to Green, if some value is entered
   b. Changed the Text Color of "Please enter data first" to Red, if the value is empty
   c. Changed the border color of the text box to RED, if the value is not entered
   d. Changed the border color of the text box to GREEN, if the value is entered
   e. Add logic for
          "Implement this case `item 1, item2,,item3`
          or this case `item 1, item2, ,item3` as not counting an 'empty'
          item towards the count of how many items there are in the list."
3. I need to figured out 1 issue - between local and bitbucket path
    For BitBucket Path - Following lines work fine [without 404 error] - Checked in Like This
      <script src="/CourseEra_Angular/module1_Solution/assignment1-starter-code/scripts/angular.min.js"></script>
      <script src="/CourseEra_Angular/module1_Solution/assignment1-starter-code/scripts/app.js"></script>
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="/CourseEra_Angular/module1_Solution/assignment1-starter-code/styles/app.css">
    For Local Code Path - Following lines work fine [without 404 error] - I need to remove /CourseEra_Angular
      <script src="/module1_Solution/assignment1-starter-code/scripts/angular.min.js"></script>
      <script src="/module1_Solution/assignment1-starter-code/scripts/app.js"></script>
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="/module1_Solution/assignment1-starter-code/styles/app.css">
